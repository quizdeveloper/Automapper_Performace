In this article I want to introduce about Automapper in C# .Net Core, how to use it and resolve the problem map object to another object in C# , I only want you to know that Automapper or manual mapper is used for different targets. If you want short code and code fast you can use Automapper but if you require for good performance you can choose manual mapper. Not which is better.
Happy code!!!
